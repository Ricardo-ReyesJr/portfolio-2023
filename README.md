# portfolio-2023
*Finally!* I get to deploy my portfolio. I know it is not the best or the greatest. Yet, I am out there. I will be doing changes
to the code as I have time to improve the website. I will change the projects as I start building better ones.

Changing the look and Style of the Personal Portfolio.

Changes made:

*   Changed the colors
*   removed the hero section.
*   cleaned the css and added bootstrap. for a cleaner and more straight forward look. kept the css for some customization like the img. the borders on the nav bar and the colors plus some shadowing.
